To run the code, you need any environment and IDLE that can run Python3, for example, Python IDLE and PyCharm. Dowload the code `tsp_solver.py ` and the dataset`ch130.tsp ` from [Traveling Salesman Problem Instances](http://elib.zib.de/pub/mp-testdata/tsp/tsplib/tsp/index.html) , and put them in the same directory. 

Open `tsp_solver.py ` file in a Python IDLE and run, then you can get the solution of the distance and a `submission.csv` file which records the visit order of cities.
